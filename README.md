# retirement-simulator
A Python script to simulate the distribution of outcomes of a simple retirement portfolio across different retirement dates

This simulator uses data derived from historical market data available on http://www.multpl.com. The structure of the portfolio and the options available (e.g. the equity glide path) were heavily influence by the excellent series on safe withdrawal rates at https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/12/07/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-1-intro/
